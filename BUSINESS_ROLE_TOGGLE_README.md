# Business Role Toggle Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a role toggle switch that allows approved business users to switch between "user" and "business" modes in the application.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. New Component: `BusinessRoleToggle.tsx`

**Location**: `/src/components/layout/BusinessRoleToggle.tsx`

**Features**:

- Only shows for users with approved business status
- Two variants: "dropdown" (for header menu) and "standalone" (for account page)
- Shows current mode with appropriate icons (User/Building icons)
- Displays business name from the approved application
- Handles loading states and error handling
- Shows toast notifications on successful/failed role switches

### 2. Updated Header Component

**Location**: `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Added BusinessRoleToggle import
- Integrated toggle in both desktop and mobile dropdown menus
- Positioned after "Account" link for logical flow

### 3. Updated Account Page

**Location**: `/src/app/account/page.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Added BusinessRoleToggle import
- Added dedicated "Business Account" section with standalone toggle
- Positioned as separate card after profile edit form

### 4. Enhanced Product API

**Location**: `/src/api/productApi.ts`

**New Function**: `getCurrentUserMode()`

- Fetches current user mode from backend
- Returns either "user" or "business" mode
- Handles errors gracefully by defaulting to "user" mode

## API Endpoints Required

### 1. Get Current Mode

```
GET /api/products/current-mode
Response: { "mode": "user" | "business" }
```

### 2. Switch Role (Already Implemented)

```
POST /api/products/switch-role
Response: { "message": "âœ… Mode switched to business", "mode": "business" }
```

### 3. Get Business Status (Already Implemented)

```
GET /api/business/user/status
Response: BusinessStatusResponse with status "approved"
```

## User Experience

### Header Dropdown Integration

- Toggle appears in user dropdown menu after "Account" link
- Only visible to users with approved business status
- Shows current mode and business name
- Switch toggles between user/business mode

### Account Page Integration

- Dedicated "Business Account" section
- Larger toggle with more detailed information
- Same functionality as header toggle but in standalone format

## Technical Details

### State Management

- Uses local state for current mode and loading states
- Fetches both business status and current mode on component mount
- Updates mode optimistically on successful API calls

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback to "user" mode if current mode fetch fails
- Toast notifications for both success and error states
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous API calls

### Conditional Rendering

- Component only renders if user has approved business status
- Handles loading states appropriately
- Fails gracefully if APIs are unavailable

## Usage

The toggle will automatically appear for users who have:

1. Applied for business status
2. Been approved by an admin
3. Are currently logged in

Users can switch between modes using either:

- The toggle in the header dropdown menu
- The toggle in their account page

Both toggles stay synchronized and show the current mode state.
